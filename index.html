          <section class="">
            <p>In my current role as a Web Designer and Front End Developer at the Oxford University's Continuing Education Department I work on online courses in a wide range of academic disciplines. I am expected to create pleasing and engaging designs for a range of user interface elements.</p>
            <p>As part of my workflow I often start with a tiny brief from the courses' authors and building on that I reach a finished product.</p>

          <h2 class="underline-small">New styles</h2>
          <p>Part of my job is creating new assets to use on our course pages. To ensure that these provide a valuable experience for our users I design easily reusable, scalable and accessible styles for the various page elements.</p>
          <p>The example below shows a prototype design for a table element and how it was then subsequently reused for a different one. You may view other examples of the same <a href="https://csomosb.github.io/demo/newstyles.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="underline-small">Style guide</h2>
          <p>The academic courses provided by my current employer are updated regularily. As part of a course review my part in the process was to create a new style guide to assist the remake of a long list of figures. The original figures were generated by specialist technical software and while carried the neccessary information for the subject were difficult to interpret and were lacking in terms of aesthetic enjoyment.</p>
          <p>To successfully recreate them first I had to ensure that I fully understand the figures. I throughoutly researched the subject - technical illustrations for Computer Science including different data models or dialogue structures. I separated them by type using a Trello board. I assigned categories for the columns and made a card for each individual figure. As the first card on the columns I gathered the technical requirements I could identify and confirmed with the academics leading the course.</p>
          <p>After the research phase was completed I first made low-fidelity wireframes and then later more detailed prototypes using Adobe Illustrator. Once the design was finished I wrote a Style Guide describing the rules I came up with. This was then used by other team members to create the new assets for the course.</p>

          <h2 class="underline-small">Interactive page elements</h2>
          <p>My specialisation in this post is creating interactive modules such as drag-and-drop exercises, interactive maps, and simple games. Outside of these I also design and develop smaller, more unusual interactives that give life to the pages.</p>
          <section id="random-num-example">
            <div id="random-num-container">
              <div id="num-container-div"><span id="num-container"></span></div>
              <button type="button" name="button" id="wordButton" onclick="randomStart()"><div class="circle circleOff" id="circle"></div>Word limit</button>
            </div>
          </section>
          <p>The brief for the example above was to have the users generate the maximum word count for a short story on a creative writing course. This course has an overarching theme of mid-twentieth century retro and with the interactive I wanted to bring to mind the image of pushing the call button on an old elevator with the panel showing the floor number.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="sub-sections">
          <h2 class="underline-small">Demo of worked projects</h2>
          <p>The first example for a larger interactive module is an interactive quiz I designed and also developed. The purpose of this interactive in its original context is to let the users generate a story based on quiz choices. The form is divided into 10 sequences, each containing six to ten questions. Once the form is submitted all of the answers are displayed in an easy to read manner.</p>
          <p>There was also a need for reviewing previously answered questions without the ability to alter them. This is the use of the side navigation menu.</p>
          <p>The idea behind the visual appearance of the form is to evoke a feeling of using a typewriter. The story generated is for an imagined film script so I wanted to let the users feel like they are actually typing this themselves.</p>
          <p>In the demo I replaced the original text with something much shorter and simpler.</p>
          <iframe id="demo-quiz"
              title="Demo of quiz interactive"
              width="800"
              height="750"
              src="https://csomosb.github.io/demo/typewriterquiz_v5.xhtml">
          </iframe>
          <p>The second example is for an activity where users listen to three extracts of a literary work where the text alternates between prose and poetry. The users are asked to mark where they think it happens by interacting with the buttons under the waveform element. Once satisfied with the answer they are asked to take a screenshot and submit to a forum they each have access to. In order to ensure the screenshots are similar enough I added a functionality for taking screenshots in browser by interacting with the button provided.</p>
          <p>This activity relies on APIs for generating the waveforms, interaction with these, and for generating the screenshots.</p>
          <p>The demo uses a different audio file and not the original reading.</p>
          <iframe id="demo-waveform"
              title="Demo of waveform interactive"
              width="800"
              height="600"
              src="https://csomosb.github.io/demo/api4.xhtml">
          </iframe>
          <p>I am now familiar with building projects around APIs both from my current job and my university studies. During my university studies I specialised in web development with a cartographic context which mostly means interactive maps. This relied on using various map APIs such as Leaflet.js or the Google Maps API.</p>

        <section class="sub-sections">
          <h2 class="underline-small">Accessibility</h2>
          <p>My mission is to ensure everybody regardless of their abilities can have the equal level of learning opportunity from our courses. In order to achieve this I need to guarantee that the page elements including the interactive modules support a high level of accessibility and can be navigated without a mouse, are not reliant on colour only, and have appropriate labels set up for screen readers. To learn more about accessibility I participated in courses on the subject.</p>
          <p>Another important accessibility issue I tackled was turning our various pdf documents readable by assistive technology. Often this meant the starting point was scanned book pages without searchable text and thus I learned how to work with character recognition techniques, setting up labels and reading order. This is deceiptfully difficult for currently there aren't software and methods readily available for achieving completely accurate results.</p>
          <p>Finally I explored accessible svg images. My goal was to convert all graphics if applicable to svg as these support aria labels and searchable text â€“ both requirements for assistive technologies.</p>

            <object data="img/sample2cleanresponsive.svg" width="700px" height="350px" alt="SVG image with accessible elements."></object>

        <section class="sub-sections">
          <h2 class="underline-small">Wordpress pages</h2>
          <p>As a side project I have created a Wordpress website for in-house usage. The aim of the site is to store various image resources â€“ sort of like a collection of bookmarks. To achieve the design I had in mind I made a child theme based on an existing one, meaning I learned how to read and edit php for this project. I also got familiar with using plug-ins as I needed a way for users to add entries without having to make their own posts and accessing the backend. I came up with the idea of using a form to generate posts.</p>

        <p>As hobbies I enjoy photography and painting (watercolour, oil, and digital). While I keep these as personal interests, I see the usefulness of them in design work. For routine image editing I frequently rely on the knowledge I gained through my photography hobby. Various design decisions I make are influenced, or rather supported by the experience I have in painting.</p>
        <p>Recently as part of my job I started learning about 3D modelling which I am interested in fully incorporating into my work skills. You can see an example of an illustration I made below.</p>
