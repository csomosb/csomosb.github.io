          <h2>Interactives</h2>
          <p>The primary focus of my role is building interactive content on the course pages. This includes the typical interactives in educational contexts such as drag-and-drop, expandable items, charts, flashcards, etc. Instead of using an existing service for this we decided to make our own to guarantee proper style integration with the rest of the course content.</p>
          <p>Outside of these I also design and develop smaller, more unusual interactives that give life to the pages.</p>

          <h2>New styles</h2>
          <p>Part of my job is creating new assets to use on our course pages. These are reusable objects that can fit a variety of contexts. I design the look and feel and then write the html, css and sometimes javascript for the element. Later they are added to our main style theme for easy usage.</p>

        <section class="sub-sections">
          <h2>Style guide</h2>
          <p>The department is running a longer course in Computer Science with graphics that were in dire need of redrawing. Various different graphs and models were once made with minimal design considerations and tables left with their default html look needed to be made modern but timeless enough to be aesthetically pleasing in the next couple of years while also communicating everything they have originally shown.</p>
          <p>For this I went through an in-depth design process. At first I didn’t have much understanding of the graphs – I’ve seen some of it during my university studies but I had no real idea of what they were supposed to show. So as a first step I had to do research.</p>
          <p>I have read the course and also looked up the figures described on other sources. As I grew to understand them I knew I had to collect the images in categories visually. In an office this could have meant printing off the images and putting them on a whiteboard but as my entire team has been working from home I came up with an idea. I created a Trello board and added columns for each identified figure type.</p>
          <img src="img/style-guide-trello-1.PNG" width="600px" alt="Screenshot of the Trello board">
          <p>I have also added Guide Notes detailing all specific requirements in terms of symbology for the individual types.</p>
          <p>After this phase I started looking at examples for these sort of images, however I found that outside of a small handful of paid services people tend to opt for very minimalistic designs, often generated by computer science related software. This meant I had to come up with my own design without existing references. I have iterated a couple of different ideas with Adobe Illustrator.</p>
          <img src="img/graphs_iteration3.PNG" width="600px" alt="Screenshot of Adobe Illustartor: Design iteration">
          <p>The ones my team liked the most I have added to a sample page to see how they work in their destination. After deciding on the best I made a Style Guide.</p>
          <p>The aim of this Style Guide was to let other team member create the new figures too. I collected all of the assets and rules into a Google Presentation.</p>
          <img src="img/style-guide-doc.PNG" width="800px" alt="Screenshot of the style guide">
          <p>Etc</p>
          <p>I made new designs for tables as well. With this the goal was a bit larger – the new designs would be incorporated into all of our courses, or rather our main theme. For this I made a couple of designs using references. The main principle I had in mind was that less is more, that we don’t really need all of those dark borders to make sense out of what’s being shown. etc</p>

          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p>Our mission is to ensure everybody regardless of abilities can have the equal level of learning opportunity from our courses without missing out on anything. In order to achieve this I needed to ensure that our interactives support a high level of accessibility and can be navigated without a mouse, are not reliant on colour only and have appropriate labels set up for screen readers.</p>
          <p>To get started with the project I participated in courses on the subject. Also a team formed around the subject and we had regular meetings to discuss and investigate accessibility in our courses.</p>
          <p>Another accessibility project I took part in was turning our various pdf documents readable by assistive technology. Often this means the starting point is a scanned document so I had to learn how to create accurate machine recognised text, set up labels and reading order. [illustrate with images]</p>
          <p>Finally I explored accessible svg images. My goal was to convert all graphics if applicable to svg as these support labels and searchable text – both requirements for assistive technologies. [illustrate]</p>

        <section class="sub-sections">
          <h2>Wordpress</h2>
          <p>I have created a Wordpress website for in-house usage. The aim of the site is to store various image resources – sort of like a library or collection of bookmarks. To achieve the design I had in mind I made a child theme based on an existing one, meaning I learned how to read and edit php for this project. I also got familiar with using plug-ins as I needed a way for users to add entries without having to make their own posts and accessing the backend. I came up with the idea of using a form to generate posts. [illustrate]</p>
