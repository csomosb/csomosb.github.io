            <p>In my current role as a Front End Developer I play a key role in the production of new online courses in arrange of academic disciplines. I work collaboratively with project managers, academic subject specialists, pedagogy experts, and other digital creatives to design and produce new learning experiences. I need to think imaginatively about the ideas expressed by authors and academics to translate those ideas into a working product.</p>
            <p>Anything I make has to match the existing in-house style guide and apply it appropriately. Investigating new online tools and services is among my core responsibilities as part of our learning design process.</p>
            <p>I am tasked with preparing image assets to acceptable standards which often involves editing those with Photoshop, a software I am experienced using alongside other Adobe components like Illustrator or XD. I undertake picture research to identify images to illustrate courses collaboratively with other team members.</p>
            <p>I devise appropriate digital solutions to enable effective online learning, observe best practice in terms of user experience, accessibility, and web standards.</p>
            <p>I need to prepare assets such as images, new UI elements, and documents. I add to the existing style guide by exploring better options and after throughout testing implementing those in the code base.</p>

          <p>My specialisation in this post is creating interactive activities such as drag-and-drop exercises, interactive maps, and simple games.

          <h2>Style guide</h2>
          <p>The academic courses my department is responsible for require regular updates to ensure they are fully up-to-date in terms of educational value. One of my major projects revolved around this principle: I was tasked with creating a new style guide for recreating the various graphics in a major computer science course.</p>
          <p>These were highly technical illustrations that were originally made without design considerations which was acceptable at the time but I had to elevate them to meet higher expectations with a modern yet timeless, aesthetically pleasing manner while communicating all of the necessary information they have originally shown.</p>
          <p>The first step to this goal was to gain an understanding of the graphs. I conducted throughout research of the various graphs used in computer science. As I made a Trello board to categories the various graph and model types as a visual aid for progressing with the design, with guide notes detailing specific technical requirements for the individual types.</p>
          <p>After research I made a couple of design to iterate on the test course pages and see what works best for our purposes. Once the design was finalised I created a Style Guide. This was used by the design team to create the new assets.</p>

          <h2>Working with APIs</h2>
          <p>I am familiar with building projects around APIs both from my current job and my university studies.</p>
          <p>An example from my live projects is this waveform interactive. The goal was to have the users listen to an audio file and add markers based on a specific criteria. Once the task was finished they were asked to generate screenshots to share on the course's forum as part of the exercise.</p>
          <p>During my university studies I specialised in web development with a cartographic context which mostly means interactive maps. This relied on using various map APIs such as Leaflet.js or the Google Maps API.</p>

          <h2>Accessibility</h2>
          <p>My mission is to ensure everybody regardless of their abilities can have the equal level of learning opportunity from our courses. In order to achieve this I need to guarantee that our interactives support a high level of accessibility and can be navigated without a mouse, are not reliant on colour only, and have appropriate labels set up for screen readers. To learn more about accessibility I participated in courses on the subject.</p>
          <p>Another important accessibility issue I tackled was turning our various pdf documents readable by assistive technology. Often this meant the starting point was scanned book pages without searchable text and thus I learned how to work with character recognition techniques, set up labels and reading order. This is deceiptfully difficult for currently there aren't software and methods readily available for achieving completely accurate results.</p>
          <p>Finally I explored accessible svg images. My goal was to convert all graphics if applicable to svg as these support aria labels and searchable text – both requirements for assistive technologies.</p>
          <div class="centre">
            <object data="img/sample2cleanresponsive.svg" width="700px" height="350px" alt="SVG image with accessible elements."></object>

          <h2>Wordpress</h2>
          <p>I have created a Wordpress website for in-house usage. The aim of the site is to store various image resources – sort of like a library or collection of bookmarks. To achieve the design I had in mind I made a child theme based on an existing one, meaning I learned how to read and edit php for this project. I also got familiar with using plug-ins as I needed a way for users to add entries without having to make their own posts and accessing the backend. I came up with the idea of using a form to generate posts.</p>
